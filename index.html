    <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <hr/>

    <h3>Machine Learning Engineer</h3>
    <p><i>Tegence AI, Lagos, Nigeria</i></p>
    <p><i>July 2023 - present</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilised pre-trained models to strategically design and implement a machine learning system, 
            enabling the extraction of facial embeddings from images. Seamlessly integrated this system 
            with database functionality while pioneering a resilient method for conducting comparative analysis
            of embedding similarities, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 97% in embedding comparisons.</li>
        <li>Engineered API routes to facilitate consumption of the face embedding model, enhancing accessibility
            and usability within the broader system architecture.</li>
        <li>Utilised the Google OCR API for precise document extraction, employing a systematic regex methodology 
            to extract pertinent details with a success rate of 95%, effectively enhancing data retrieval from diverse documents.</li>
        <li>Researched, designed and implemented a machine learning model for voice recognition, achieving a commendable accuracy rate of 75%.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Associate Machine Learning Engineer</h3>
    <p><i>Prunedge, Lagos, Nigeria</i></p>
    <p><i>Feb 2021 - Feb 2022</i></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Collaborated with research engineers in developing a machine learning model (Siamese Network) for determining the similarity
             between facial images in a face recognition system used by close to 10 million people.</li>
        <li>Developed and embedded an optical character recognition (OCR) model for document parsing into a mobile application.</li>
        <li>Optimised said OCR system and sped up the recognition process by 62%, applying Tensorflow Lite to shrink the model size.</li>
        <li>Collaborated extensively on other projects with the IoT (Internet of Things), Data Engineering, Data Science, Quality Assurance, 
            and Software Engineering teams.</li>
        <li>Undertook a mentorship role, guiding a group of 6 interns through challenges and fostering their growth, technical proficiency 
            and successful project execution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Machine Learning Intern</h3>
    <p><i>Tegence AI, Lagos, Nigeria</i></p>
    <p><i>Jan 2020 - Jan 2021</i></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Developed a convolutional neural network model for detecting melanoma skin cancer and achieved a 73% prediction accuracy.</li>
        <li>Worked on the training and development of a noise reduction tool for removing noise from an audio signal and reaching an accuracy of 80%.</li>
        <li>Curated and augmented expansive audio and image datasets, employing a combination of manual annotation and automated extraction techniques. 
            The enriched datasets substantially elevated the training of recognition and generation models in both audio and image domains, resulting in 
            marked enhancements in model accuracy and overall performance.
        </li>
    </ul>
